	<h1>The Mott Hall School Chess Program</h1>

	<p>In 1994, Mott Hall became the first inner city chess team to become National Champions. The team coached by now Grand Master Maurice Ashley defied the odds and broke barriers. Ever since then, Chess has been King in the school! With more than 10 Nationals Titles and 2 in the last 3 years, Chess has remained a vital part of the school. Visitors are greeted by a wall full of chess trophies and plaques. Every child in the school, learns chess on six grade and the chess team meets two times per week. The chess team plays in two to three tournaments per month and travels to the Spring Nationals every year since 1994!</p>
